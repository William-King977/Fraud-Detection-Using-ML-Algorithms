# About
- Both unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms are used on two different contexts of fraud. 
- The performances of each model is explored with the use of performance metrics, permutation importance and 
  PDPBox plots.
- A visualisation tool is then built to help visualise and interact with each model's predictions.

# This Directory Holds
- <b>DataSets:</b> Folder holding the data sets used for the project.
- <b>Metric Drops:</b> Folder holding the metric drop implementation for each unsupervised algorithm (not essential).
- <b>Audit Data:</b> Jupyter notebook holding the PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION for Audit data set.
- <b>kmeans_predict:</b> A seperate file used to assist the prediction stage for kMeans.
- <b>Warranty Claims:</b> Jupyter notebook holding the PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION for Warranty Claims data set.

# Additional Notes About The Visualisation Tool
 - For the Jupyter notebooks, you can interact with the visualisation tools without 'running' 
   the code (scroll to the end of the Notebook).
 - The visualisation tool will show the most recent predictions of each model.
 - There is no method of 'resetting' the data points on the visualisation tool, once the data has 
   been filtered by the drop down menus. It's recommended to create a copy of a Notebook and 
   use the copy instead.
 - You can zoom in and out by placing your mouse on a graph and scroll.
 - You can also drag the graphs (they're multi-coordinated).

# UPDATES SINCE PROJECT SUBMISSION:
 - Added dynamic axis selection for the visualisation tools.
 - Added PCA axis option for the visualisation tools.
